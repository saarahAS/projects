      <h2>A short biography of Prophet Muhammad</h2>
      <h3>Timeline:</h3>
      <div id="timeline">
        <ul>
          <li>
            He was born in Makkah in what is now Saudi Arabia around 570 CE.
          </li>
          <li>
            His father, Abdullāh died before he was born, and his mother died
            before he was six, so he was first brought up by his paternal
            grandfather.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was born into the Hāshim clan which was part of the Quraysh
            tribe.
          </li>
          <li>The name Muhammad means “the praised”.</li>
          <li>
            He built up a reputation for being trustworthy, truthful and honest,
            so he was given the nickname, Al-Amīn (The Trustworthy).
          </li>
          <li>
            In 595 CE, when he was 25, he married Khadījah, a wealthy lady, and
            started a family with her.
          </li>
          <li>In 613CE, at the age of 40, the Quran was revealed to him.</li>
          <li>
            In the 14th year after receiving Prophethood (622CE), he migrated to
            Madinah whilst the people of the city eagerly awaited his arrival.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Islamic calendar is dated to this journey of the Prophet from
            Makkah to Madinah.
          </li>
          <li>
            Muhammad ruled with justice and was loved by the people of Madinah.
          </li>
          <li>He died on 8 June 632 AD in Medina, Saudi Arabia.</li>
        </ul>
